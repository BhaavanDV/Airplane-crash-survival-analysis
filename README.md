# Airplane Crash Survival Analysis
This project analyzes airplane crash data to study factors influencing survival rates. Using data from various airplane crashes, the goal is to explore and visualize trends, relationships, and patterns that could predict survival outcomes. The analysis includes visualizations, statistical calculations, and machine learning models to understand the impact of various features on survival chances.

# Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains details about airplane crashes, including information about the airline, the number of fatalities, the number of survivors, the aircraft type, the operator, and the location of the crash.

# Key Features:
- Operator: The airline operating the flight.
- Fatalities: The number of fatalities in the crash.
- Survivors: The number of survivors in the crash.
- Year: The year the crash occurred.
- Location: The location where the crash occurred.
- Aircraft: The aircraft model involved in the crash.
- Cause: The cause of the crash (if available).
- 
# Project Goals
- Analyze trends and patterns in airplane crash data over time.
- Explore the relationship between various features (e.g., operator, aircraft model) and survival rates.
- Visualize the distribution of fatalities and survivors across different years and operators.
- Investigate the impact of crash-related factors on survival chances.
  
# Analysis & Findings
This project includes the following key analyses and visualizations:
1. Total Fatalities by Year: A visualization showing how fatalities have changed over the years.
2. Operator Performance: A bar chart displaying the top operators with the highest number of fatalities.
3. Fatalities vs. Survivors: A comparison of fatalities and survivors across different years.
4. Survival Proportions: An analysis of survival proportions across different operators.
5. Word Cloud: A word cloud to visualize the most common reasons and locations associated with crashes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Wordcloud for generating visual representation of crash-related terms
- Jupyter Notebook for code development and visualization
